**Feature Branch**: `001-it-s-been`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "It's been a while from last update of this book. Let's keep up-to-date the contents of this book."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a learner studying JavaScript through this tutorial book, I need the content to reflect current JavaScript standards and best practices so that I can learn relevant, up-to-date knowledge applicable to today's development environment. The book's core content was last substantially updated in 2021 (4 years ago), with minor updates in April 2023.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a learner reads the ECMAScript version references, **When** they check the current year and latest ECMAScript version, **Then** the book should reference the most recent stable ECMAScript version (ES2024 or ES2025)
2. **Given** a learner reads about JavaScript features, **When** they encounter feature descriptions and examples, **Then** the content should reflect modern JavaScript practices widely adopted in the industry as of 2025
3. **Given** a learner follows external reference links in the book, **When** they click on documentation or resource links, **Then** the links should point to current, accessible resources
4. **Given** a learner reads about browser compatibility, **When** they see information about which browsers support which features, **Then** the compatibility information should reflect the current state of modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge as of 2025)
5. **Given** a learner encounters deprecated patterns or features, **When** they read the content, **Then** outdated approaches should be clearly marked as legacy with guidance toward modern alternatives

### Edge Cases
- What happens when external links (MDN, TC39, compatibility tables) have moved or changed URLs?
- How does the book handle features that were experimental in 2021 but are now stable or standardized?
- How should content address features that were recommended in 2021 but are now considered anti-patterns?
- What about JavaScript features introduced between 2021-2025 (ES2022, ES2023, ES2024, ES2025) that should be included?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Content MUST reference the latest stable ECMAScript version as of 2025 (ES2024 or ES2025)
- **FR-002**: All external links (MDN documentation, TC39 specifications, compatibility tables, etc.) MUST be verified and updated to current URLs
- **FR-003**: Browser compatibility information MUST reflect the current state of major browsers as of 2025
- **FR-004**: Code examples MUST use modern JavaScript syntax and patterns that are widely supported in 2025
- **FR-005**: Features and APIs that have become deprecated or obsolete since 2021 MUST be marked as such with alternatives provided
- **FR-006**: New JavaScript features introduced between 2021-2025 (ES2022, ES2023, ES2024, ES2025) that are relevant for beginners MUST be evaluated for inclusion
- **FR-007**: Content about transpilers and polyfills MUST reflect the current state of these tools (Babel, TypeScript, etc.) as of 2025
- **FR-008**: References to browser versions, Node.js versions, and other runtime environments MUST be updated to current stable versions
- **FR-009**: Performance recommendations and best practices MUST align with current industry standards as of 2025
- **FR-010**: All factual claims about JavaScript ecosystem (frameworks, libraries, tools) MUST be verified against current reality

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Content Section**: A chapter or page in the tutorial book containing explanations, code examples, and references about a specific JavaScript topic
- **Code Example**: Executable JavaScript code snippet demonstrating a concept or feature
- **External Reference**: Links to authoritative sources (MDN, ECMAScript spec, compatibility tables, tool documentation)
- **Version Reference**: Mentions of specific versions (ECMAScript editions, browser versions, Node.js versions)
- **Feature Description**: Explanation of a JavaScript language feature, API, or pattern
